  <summary><h3> üöÄ Arjo's Programming Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey when I was about 8 years old. I began with basic HTML, and over time, learned to use JavaScript and CSS for backend development and styling. Gradually, I developed an interest in App Development and took a course a IOS App Development with Swift. As I continued the path of App Development, I decided to take on Python, a language that I would grow to become proficient in and utilize for almost all my projects. Recently, I have started learning about AI Development and Machine Learning. I now focus on building large scale real world applications that can be of real use in the future.
